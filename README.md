# Analysis of Kernel Function in the Naive-Bayes Kernel Classifier Method on Hadith Data
This project is based on a journal: "An Effective Arabic Text Classification Approach Based on Kernel Naive Bayes Classifier". A method for text classification with Kernel Naive-Bayes probability feature selection. A collaboration with my colleague, Yulia Dwi Lestari, is ongoing to implement this method for hadith data as her thesis research: "Klasifikasi Data Teks Menggunakan Kernel Naive-Bayes Feature Selection untuk Data Hadis".
